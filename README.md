# 🚦 Traffic Flow Prediction and Visualization System

## 🧠 Overview
The **Traffic Flow Prediction System** is an interactive web application that uses **Machine Learning (XGBoost)** to predict and visualize real-time traffic conditions.  
It helps analyze congestion trends, identify high-traffic zones, and improve decision-making for smart city and transportation management systems.

This app integrates **data analytics**, **interactive visualization**, and **predictive modeling** into one easy-to-use Streamlit interface.
